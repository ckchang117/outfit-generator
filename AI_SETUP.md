# AI-Powered Outfit Generation Setup

## Implementation Complete! ðŸŽ‰

I've implemented the AI-powered outfit generation feature using OpenAI's Assistants API. Here's what was added:

### New Features

1. **Catalog Agent (VLM)** - Analyzes clothing photos when uploaded to extract:
   - Colors, patterns, materials
   - Category and subcategory  
   - Season appropriateness
   - Formality level
   - Style tags
   - Brand (if visible)
   - Fit assessment
   
   **Note**: User-specific data like size, purchase info, care instructions, etc. are stored separately in a `user_metadata` JSON field that you can manage independently.

2. **Stylist Agent** - Generates outfit suggestions based on:
   - User's request/prompt
   - Weather and occasion
   - Clothing metadata
   - Style coherence
   - Color coordination

### Files Created/Modified

- `package.json` - Added OpenAI SDK dependency
- `scripts/add-item-metadata-columns.sql` - Database migration for new metadata
- `src/lib/supabase-data.ts` - Updated types for new fields
- `src/lib/openai-assistants.ts` - OpenAI Assistants manager
- `app/api/analyze-item/route.ts` - API endpoint for clothing analysis
- `app/api/generate-outfit/route.ts` - API endpoint for outfit generation
- `src/app.tsx` - Updated to use new API endpoints

### Setup Instructions

1. **Run the database migration** in Supabase SQL editor:
   ```sql
   -- Copy contents from scripts/add-item-metadata-columns.sql
   ```

2. **Add environment variables** to `.env.local`:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```

3. **Initialize OpenAI Assistants** (one-time setup):
   - Run the app and check the server console
   - You'll see logs with assistant IDs to add to `.env.local`:
   ```env
   OPENAI_CATALOG_ASSISTANT_ID=asst_xxxxx
   OPENAI_STYLIST_ASSISTANT_ID=asst_xxxxx
   ```

4. **Restart the development server** to load new env vars

### How It Works

1. **When adding items**: Photos are automatically analyzed by the Catalog Agent after upload
2. **When generating outfits**: The Stylist Agent uses the analyzed metadata to create smart outfit combinations
3. **Fallback**: If AI fails, it falls back to the random selection method

### Features

- Persistent conversation threads per user
- Smart category matching (ensures proper coverage)
- Season and weather awareness
- Style coherence checking
- Multiple outfit alternatives
- Performance tracking

### Next Steps

- Test the outfit generation with various prompts
- Monitor the OpenAI usage/costs
- Consider adding:
  - Loading states during AI processing
  - Manual re-analysis button
  - Outfit rating/feedback
  - Weather API integration

### Troubleshooting

- If analysis fails: Check OpenAI API key and assistant IDs
- If generation fails: Ensure you have items with metadata
- Check browser console and server logs for detailed errors

Enjoy your AI-powered outfit generator! ðŸŽ¨ðŸ‘”ðŸ‘—
